# My Codeyard

In here are things that I programmed in my spare time where I don't feel like they need their own repository

This includes
* coding contests
* some crazy ideas
* learning a new programming language or framework
* just to quickly check if something works

The code quality varies **wildly**. Please do not take a random sample and assume anything from that about my professional work.
