# My Codeyard

In here are things that I programmed in my spare time where I don't feel like they need their own repository

This includes
* coding contests
* some crazy ideas
* learning a new programming language or framework
* just to quickly check if something works

The code quality varies **wildly**. Please do not take a random sample and assume anything from that about my professional work.

# Some things I'm proud of

## WebCommand
[Link](https://github.com/happyherp/littlethings/tree/master/webcmnd)

Language: Stackless Python

Demonstrates how Microthreads can be used to invert the interaction between a website and server-side-code. Instead defining a method that will be called with a http-request and returning a response, you call a function that sends a response to the user and returns the next request. 

## Webwatch
[Link](https://github.com/happyherp/littlethings/tree/master/webwatch)

Language: Javascript and a little Python

A (prototype) library that records the interaction of a user with a website (dom-changes, mouse movement, etc). This record can be replayed later.

## A Prime Number Generator
[Link](https://github.com/happyherp/littlethings/tree/master/prime)

Language: Haskell

Multiple Iterations of a programm that tries to quickly generate primes. I wrote a 
[blogpost](http://codefreund.blogspot.com/2016/12/primes-in-haskell.html) 
about it. 

## Socketfront
[Link](https://github.com/happyherp/littlethings/tree/master/socketfront)

Language: Java/Javascript

A prototype for a framework for controlling a GUI that runs in the clients browser from a Java server. Which in the end lets you build a webapp very much as if you were writing a Swing-GUI. Similiar to [Vaadin](https://vaadin.com/).


## Project Euler Solutions
