Things i could add:

-extensible flow-elements, for selecting things, etc

-controlling wether a flowid that has been used, can be used again, and what should then happen. 

-random id-generation to prevent guessing

-persisting of old flows, so memory does not get eaten over time.

-gracefully handle access to an invalid flow-id.

-add functionality for ending a flow?

-implement something that avoid the error that comes when the url is reentered.
