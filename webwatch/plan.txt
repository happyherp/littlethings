THe plan:

Observed
1. Send a snapshot of the complete current state of the website
2. detect changes, bundle after some timer interval, send as well

changes include:
  current time
  modification of visible DOM-Elements. This excludes javascript
  path the mouse makes. Clicks
  scrollbar movements.
  window resizing.
  zoom of text, if possible

Server:
receive incoming requests. use cookies to identify users, use current domain to identify website.

save those changes.
deliver on demand by watcher

have a website where owners of website can see a list of users and
some summary of their activity. Users can be watched live, or a recorded user-experience can be viewed. 

Observer
Whatever the case, a new window is opened.
here the inital snapshot put into the document.
then the changes are displayed with the appropiate time delay
-a speed-display variant would be nice and easily implemented...


todo: 
how to detect dom changes?
what would be a good format for the initial snaphot and the changes?
-brute method is scanning the complete DOM in regular invals and comparing to previous one...
