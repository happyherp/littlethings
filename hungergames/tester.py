# This test program should identify the common mistakes
# that you can make, and suggest how you can fix them.
# There are many other things that can be checked, and
# we advise you to add the test cases yourself.

# HOW TO EXECUTE:

# If you are using python shell:
#   import tester
#   tester.run_tests('filename_of_your_script.py')
# If you are using the command line:
#   python tester.py filename_of_your_script.py
